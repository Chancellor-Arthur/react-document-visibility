## @chancellor-arthur/use-document-visibility

## Implemented react hook, which

##### will tell if the browser tab is active (visible) now
##### will tell you how many times since the component was initialized the tab has become inactive (invisible)
##### will provide a function in which you can subscribe to a change in the activity (visibility) of the current tab
